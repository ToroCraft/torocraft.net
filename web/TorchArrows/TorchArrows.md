# Torch Arrows Mod


![Torch Arrow Graphic](img/torch_arrow.png)

Torch Arrows allow a player to use a bow to place torches from a distance.  Used similarly to tipped and spectral arrows, by placing a Torch Arrow in the offhand slot.

## Crafting

<% recipe({
	slot2: 'coal',
	slot5: 'stick',
	slot8: 'feather',
	result: 'torch-arrow'
}) %>

## Combat

Torch Arrows do less damage than normal arrows (exact number is being calculated).  An idea under consideration would give torch arrows a random chance to set an attacked entity on fire.
